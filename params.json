  "body": "##### _Serine is an abbreviation for Serial Network and a chemical compound â€“ after all, the protocol was born in a chemistry laboratory. Serine has two optical isomers: L-serine, the well-known proteinogenic amino acid, and D-serine, a signaling substance in bacteria and a neurotransmitter in humans. Therefore, Serine is anyway about communication among small and big things._\r\n\r\nSerine Protocol is a light communication protocol intended to be used with small microcontrollers and some sort of serial communication channels, such as UART, RS232, I2C, USB, and so on. Some headlines guided its formulation and usage:\r\n\r\n * The exchanged messages should be easily and unequivocally interpreted by a simple microcontroller.\r\n\r\n * The messages should resist, as originally generated, to the particularities of all hardware and software protocols used over the entire network.\r\n\r\n * The messages should be as readable and writable as possible by humans.\r\n\r\nSome scientific papers in which the Serine Protocol (formerly LAIA Protocol) was used in developing of the instrumentation\r\n---\r\n\r\n- Francisco, K.
